### Augmenting Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with a Cache

英特尔的工作

They augment recurrent GNNs with cache memory to improve their expressivity, especially for modeling long-range dependencies. we first introduce a method of augmenting recurrent GNNs with a cache of previous hidden states

把常见的cache 搬到rgnn, 提升模型 acc 能力.
