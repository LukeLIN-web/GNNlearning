can you compute the personalized PageRank vectors for the following users? If so, how?

##### 1.1

Eloise, whose interests are represented by the teleport set {2}.



##### 1.2

Following 1.1, Felicity, whose interests are represented by the teleport set {5}. 

##### 1.3

 Following 1.1, Glynnis, whose interests are represented by the teleport set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with weights  w = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2]

##### 1.4

 Personalized PageRank II Suppose that youâ€™ve already computed the personalized PageRank vectors of a set of users (denote the computed vectors V ). What is the set of all personalized PageRank vectors that you can compute from V without accessing the web graph?
